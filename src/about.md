Hi, I'm Michael Herold. I am a software developer specializing in web applications. I currently work mostly in Ruby and Javascript. I love to write open source software and talk about it.

When I'm not in front of the computer, I enjoy hiking with my wife, Kate. I love reading, music and photography. My sports of choice are baseball (go Reds!) and soccer.

## My Colophon

My blog is built on [Jekyll][jekyll] and hosted on [Github Pages][pages]. I use a [hand-crafted style][style] that I made using Gulp, Sass, Bourbon, and Bitters.

I use the [Noto Sans][noto] font from Google for the body text. To improve the rendering performance on low-powered devices, I use a custom subset of Noto that is dynamically replaced once the full font loads.
